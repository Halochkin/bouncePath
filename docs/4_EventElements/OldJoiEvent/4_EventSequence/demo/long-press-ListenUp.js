//1. The event trigger function for the primary event is set up.
//2. The event trigger function for the primary event is registered. This subscription runs always.
//   Every time there is a `mousedown`, there will be a cost for processing the long-press event.
//3. The trigger functions filters out `mousedown`/`mouseup events that are not left-clicks.
//4. In normal circumstances, the primary event trigger function (`onMousedown(e)`) will store the
//   trigger event and then add the trigger event functions for the secondary trigger events.
//5. The secondary trigger event function is set up.
//6. When the final trigger event function (`onMouseup(e)`) is triggered, it will check
//   that the press lasted more than 300ms before it dispatches the composed event.
//7. When the EventSequence finishes, it resets its TakeNotes.
//8. When the EventSequence finishes, it removes all secondary trigger function listeners.
//   Resetting the state means both clearing TakeNotes and removing ListenUp secondary event listeners.
