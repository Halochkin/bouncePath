## Pattern: ListenUp

## Why ListenUp?

To listen for events in JS can be expensive. If you listen for events such as `wheel`, `scroll`, `touchmove`, and `touchstart`, then your app can quickly start to lag (cf. PayAttention). And this can be a problem for EventSequences. If an EventSequence *always* listens for *all* events, it can lag. 

To make EventSequences more efficient, we can use the ListenUp pattern. ListenUp reduces the cost of event listeners by adding them *as late as possible*.

## HowTo: ListenUp
 
1. An EventSequence observes *two or more different event types*. 

2. The event types must follow a particular order.

3. The EventSequence therefore *adds and removes* event listeners when it switches from one state to the next, ie. the EventSequence "listens up" for new types of events when it switches states.

## Demo: Naive `long-press`

Let's look at this pattern in a basic `long-press` EventSequence:

1. When the `long-press` is in the *inactive* state, it only needs to listen for `mousedown` events; when the `long-press` is in the *active* state, it only needs to listen for `mouseup` events. 

2. Instead of registering *both* `mousedown` and `mouseup` event listeners at startup, the `long-press` EventSequence registers *only* an event listener for `mousedown` at startup when the EventSequence is inactive.

3. When a `mousedown` event occurs, the EventSequence switches state and becomes *active*. At this time, the EventSequence removes the event listener for `mousedown` and instead adds an event listener for `mouseup`.

4. Finally, when the press ends, the EventSequence reverts back to the *inactive* state. At this time, the EventSequence reverses this process and removes the `mouseup` listener and adds the `mousedown` listener again.

Comment: Listening for both `mousedown` and `mouseup` is not a big performance problem: `mousedown` and `mouseup` are relatively infrequent and rare events. Therefore, for `long-press`, it might be just as costly to add/remove event listeners with the ListenUp pattern as it would be to simply listen for both events all constantly. But, this is *not(!)* the case for high-frequency events such as `mousemove` and `touchmove`. Therefore, I recommend using the ListenUp pattern by default, and instead revert to a simplistic listen-all-the-time strategy if you end up with an event listener that does not need ListenUp.
