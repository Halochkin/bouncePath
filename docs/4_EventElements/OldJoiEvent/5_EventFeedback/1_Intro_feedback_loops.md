# WhatIs: Feedback

Most systems either shows a sign, makes a sound, or moves when a user interacts with it. For example, if you flip a light switch, it a) makes a click sound, b) your finger feels how the switch changes physical position, c) light appears, and d) you can even see the switch has been flipped. These responses are feedback to the user from the light switch system.

**Feedback loops** are systems that directly integrate feedback in their controls. For example, lawn mowers control their engine speed automatically via a mechanical governor “that uses gears and flyweights inside the crankcase to detect changes in the load and adjusts the throttle accordingly”. Boat keels can be designed so as to right a boat automatically if it capsizes. In feedback loops, system output such as RPM and boat orientation is input for the control system when it directs the further running of the machine.

# Humans in feedback loops

We humans like to think that when we are using a machine, we are not part of a feedback loop. We like to think that the machine presents us with information about its state, and that we then make *conscious*, independent decisions based solely on what we want. We feel smart and free and in control. 

We do not think that the machine partially is controlling us. Obviously, this is wrong. Human decisions are more often instinctive and automatic than controlled and deliberate. We react to what we see, hear and feel. Instinctively. Automatically. 

Just think about riding a bike as an example. At first, the responses and feedback from the system require conscious and deliberate actions on your part. To learn how to ride a bike is hard. But, after a while, you train your mind to automatically adjust to the bike’s handlebars, pedals, breaks and gears. At that point, the human mind and the bike machine functions as a feedback loop: your mind/body will automatically right the bike if feedback from the bike tells you that the bike is about to tip over.

Web user interfaces are full of such feedback loops. 5 minutes are you first learned to operate a mouse, you automated the control. The mouse still sends you visual feedback about its position on screen, you just don't consciously process them anymore. Sure, you decide where you want to go with a bike and what to click on with the mouse, but at a lower level, the process of riding the bike or moving the mouse is automatic.

These feedback loops are planted by developers in UX systems, and then spread and grow gradually as more and more users automate them and other systems adopt them. This means that when we design UX and compose events, we must not only think of them as a sequence of actions a user will consciously manage, but as gestures that the user will strive to automate. 

Furthermore, when a user encounters a web interface, he/she will automatically try to use his/her already automated actions. If the user wishes to navigate to something, he/she might as if automated try to move the mouse and click it. It wouldn't help if you wrote with bright red letters across the middle of the screen "no mouse", he/she will still reach for the mouse and try to remove the big red letters from the screen. Actions and gestures "automated" into the users *stick*: you can almost think of your users more as a single, fudgy set of ingrained habits, rather than as wilful, conscious, individual actors.

Both future and established patterns of automated behavior is therefore very important when designing the UX of gestures and composed events.
