  Try to scroll or double tap.

  The problem is that it is too late to set
  touch-action or pointer-action for the native gesture
  once the initial touchstart event is dispatched.
  This is always evident for drag-to-scroll, and
  can also be illustrated with doubletap-to-zoom
  in Chrome android desktop view.
