# When: past- and future-tense events

> Normal mail and post also represent state changes. For example, bills are sent to announce a future state change: someone is about to owe someone else some money, soon; Christmas cards are sent to announce past state changes: this family is soooo happy and has evolved soooo much the previous year.

Events are always viewed in relationship to state changes. They always follow a state change, and their raison d'Ãªtre is to trigger yet other state changes.

Events are not sent in the middle of a state change. Events are always dispatched either *before* or *after* a completed state change. For example, the `contextmenu` event is dispatched *before* the browser shows its native context menu; the `change` event is dispatched *after* an input element has changed its value. We divide such events in two categories:

1. **Past-tense events** announce a past, completed state change. Examples include:
   * the `toggle` event dispatched after a `<details>` element is `open`ed,
   * the `reset` event dispatched after a `<form>` is `.reset()`, 
   * the `dblclick` event dispatched after two quick `click`s,
   * many, many more.

2. **Future-tense events** announce a future, coming state change. Examples include:
   * the `click` event dispatched before the task of targeting a `submit` event at a `<form>`,
   * the `submit` event dispatched before the task of submitting a `<form>`s data to a server,
   * the `beforeinput` event dispatched before the task of altering the value of an input element has been carried out,
   * many, many more.

## One man's past is another man's future 
   
One event instance can be *both* past- and future-tense. In fact, all future-tense events represent a past-tense state change too:
* The `click` event not only announce the ensuing `submit` event, but also the preceding `mousedown` and `mouseup` event on a common DOM element.
* The `submit` event represents both a *past* state change (a submit button *has been* `click`ed) and a *coming* state-change (a form will be submitted).

Similarly, new state changing tasks can be associated with any event during its propagation. Hence, any *past*-tense event can be made to trigger *future* state changes. In fact, this is the point of past-tense events: if no one adds any state changing tasks to a past-tense event, it can be ignored/skipped.

But, from the vantage point of the *a state changing task*, different events can precede it or follow it: a function changing some state can choose to dispatch an event before the state is changed (future-tense) or after the state has been changed (past-tense). For example:
 * If you add an event listener for `click` events on a node in the DOM, then any `click` events that occur on that node will be a future-tense event from the vantage point of this event listener.
 * The `reset` event is dispatched at the end of the `.reset()` function that resets a form. The state change of the form *has ended* when the `reset` event propagates. From the vantage point of the `.reset()` function the `reset` event is *past-tense*.

## *Ongoing* state changes 

Regretfully, state changes often take time and/or have blurry definitions of their beginning/end. In these instances, events often need to be dispatched in what can be perceived like an ongoing state change. Let's look at some examples:

### Ongoing `mousemove`
  
On the face of it, moving the mouse seems intuitively divided into a series of individual past-tense `mousemove` events. The `mousemove` events are also "made" by the browser. But, there might be other better past-tense divisions:
* `mousemove` events are not evenly divided in the *space* of the state changes: the `mousemove` dots can be far apart when the user moves the mouse too fast.
* `mousemove` events are not evenly divided in the *time* of state changes: there are no `mousemove` events dispatched when the user holds the mouse still, and that means no way for a script to locate the mouse position.  
* `mousemove` events are frequent and thus costly for performance.

To reduce both a) the gaps in space between `mousemove` points and b) the need for frequent `mousemove` events, a `mousemove-vector` event could instead stipulate a movement vector which stipulated direction, curvature, speed, and acceleration, and only dispatch new `mousemove-vector` events whenever the mouse movement deviates from this path. Similarly, the current position of the mouse could be made available as a property in the browser. This would reduce the need for `mousemove` event listeners whose sole purpose is to track this position. A completed state change is not necessarily a fixed point in a state space, but could just as easily be considered changing a change of one or two vectors.

### 1x `wheel` => 10x `scroll`  

In the good old days of web programming, animation was achieved by altering the position of an element frame by frame. And, `scroll` still lives in this timezone. To scroll a page, the viewport is moved up and down, once per frame.

However, when you for example turn the `wheel` once up or down, this action is translated into a motion curve for the `document` element. To achieve this effect, the browser translates the `wheel` event into ~10 `scroll` events which in turn is spread across the next 10 animation frames and that moves the document up or down in the viewport according to an ease-in, ease-out motion.
  
Again, the state change of `scroll` could be viewed as a series of vectors, instead of points. If the `scrollTop` property could be animated the same way as a CSS style property, then instead of animating the `scroll` old-school as 10 discrete movements, once per animation frame, a single `scroll` event with a set of motion vectors could be dispatched.

### One for all, all for one: the SUE pattern 
 
Often, smaller state changes are part of a bigger picture. For example, *many* `mousemove` or `touchmove` events might become *one* drag or swipe gesture: a sequence of small state changes *becomes* an instance of a big state change. Another example is the progressbar. Imagine an app with a loading task that takes a long time. The app could illustrate the state of the loading task with a throbber: a symbol of an ongoing, singular state change (started, but not yet completed). But, the longer the wait, the more the throbber fills the users with uncertainty about the app's overall state/health. So, instead, you could break down the big loading task into 1% increments and then illustrate this sequence of smaller state changes as a progressbar. Here, one big state change is *broken down* into many smaller state changes.

The big state change and the sequence of smaller state changes are two sides of the same coin. They exist in parallel. But. There are some quirks too: From the vantage point of the small state change, each individual state change exist by themselves, independent of each other. However, from the vantage point of the big, "overall" state change, there is a special relationship between all the small state changes that comprise it, that doesn't exist with other such small state changes. The overarching state change needs to cluster its smaller state changes; it needs to know which smaller state changes that make it up. (ok, that was fairly philosophical. Let's be more concrete.)

Enter the SUE pattern. The SUE pattern cluster a series of smaller individual state changes under the umbrella of a bigger, holistic state change. An it simply does so by 1) marking the start and end of the bigger, upper state change, and then b) assume that all smaller state changes that fall between the start and end sequence belongs to the same sequence. The beginning and end of the big, holistic state change is marked with a `-start` and `-end` event. Between the `-start` and `-end` event a series of `-move` or `-update` events are filled in. `Start`,`Update`,`update`,`update`,`End` (ie. SUE). Each individual, smaller event signals its own past-tense state change. However, other functions can choose to view the SUE event sequence as *one* holistic, ongoing state change with events updating-in-place.  

There are several SUE implementations in the browser:
 * `dragstart`, `drag`, `dragend` events gives a holistic view of `mousedown`, `mousemove` and `mouseup` events for certain type of HTML elements.
 * `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend` describe the individual steps of finger gestures on touch screen devices. However, the SUE pattern is not a good fit for touch. Because the users have ten fingers. Sometimes all thumbs. So, when the user touches the screen with multiple fingers at the same time, multiple SUE events will be dispatched for different fingers at the same time. The same `touchmove` might represent movement for different fingers, and it is not necessarily clear which `touchend` is paired with which `touchstart`. The developers is left with a choice: cross his fingers and hope that the user doesn't cross his fingers during the gesture (ie. use the gesture perfectly), or establish new SUE patterns on top of the native touch SUE. More on this in the chapter about event controllers. 
 * `compositionstart`, `compositionupdate`, `compositionend` describe the individual steps in text input with dead keys.

## `target.dispatchEvent(...)`

When a component changes state, the component calls `EventTarget.dispatchEvent(event)` to alert the event system of the message. There are several aspects of this method call that need to be considered, and we will do so in this chapter.
